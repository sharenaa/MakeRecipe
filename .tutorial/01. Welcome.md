# 💻 Introduction to HTML  

## 🎯 Task - Part 1:  Make a Recipe (HTML) 

* You will be introduced to your first 5 HTML tags; **inserting an image, headings, paragraph, unordered lists** and **ordered lists**. 

*  Using the **index.html** file create your very own recipe card. Use the **code clips** to help find the code you need.

Be creative it does not have to be a banana smoothie recipe but it must match the [Wireframe Design](recipeFormat.png)  This points out the **HTML tags** the designer wishes for you to use.

## Remember

<p></p>
🐞Everyone gets bugs, this is expected. Use the **code clips** to help you fix the bugs, do one at a time. 
<p></p>
🏁Test regularly, run your program and test with each new line.

#### We will revisit this project and add colour after some debug tasks.

### Good luck! 🍀 and have fun
