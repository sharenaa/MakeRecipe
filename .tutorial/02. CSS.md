# 💻 Introduction to HTML  

## 🎯 Task - Part 2:  Make a Recipe (CSS)

* You will be introduced to your first set of CSS properties; background color, image height and width, font color, size, weight, alignment and family. 

*  Now it is time to add to your **HTML recipe card** you created and format it using relevant CSS tags to achieve their desired effect.
  
Using the **css.html** file add at least one of each of the **css properties** listed in **code clips**.  Use the **code clips** to help find the code you need. *Be creative!*

## Remember

🐞Everyone gets bugs, this is expected. Use the **code clips** to help you fix the bugs, do one at a time.

🏁Test regularly, run your program and test with each new line.

## 🏁 Finished
* Once you have completed your recipe with **html** and **css** submit it to your teacher.
